- [x] Sketch the basic RAG pipeline for Axiom AI (demo scale)

---

## Deliverables

### 1. README.md ✅
**Location**: `README.md`

**Contents**:
- ✅ Project description
- ✅ Key features (multilingual, accuracy, latency)
- ✅ **"How to Run" section with 2 commands**:
  ```bash
  python scripts/ingest.py path/to/document.pdf
  python -m axiom.query --query "Your question"
  ```
- ✅ Evaluation results (EN + HI metrics)

**Status**: Complete and professional

---

### 2. Architecture Documentation ✅
**Location**: `docs/architecture.md`

**Contents**:
- ✅ System overview
- ✅ **Component diagram** (Mermaid format)
  - Ingestion flow
  - Query flow
  - Evaluation flow
- ✅ Detailed component descriptions
- ✅ Technology stack table
- ✅ Design principles
- ✅ Performance characteristics
- ✅ Future enhancements

**Status**: Complete with visual diagrams

---

### 3. System Design Sketch ✅
**Location**: `docs/SYSTEM_DESIGN.md`

**Contents**:
- ✅ **Simplified RAG pipeline diagram** (ASCII art)
- ✅ Component responsibilities table
- ✅ Data flow examples (ingestion, query, evaluation)
- ✅ Demo scale vs production scale comparison
- ✅ Design decision rationale
- ✅ Success metrics table
- ✅ Interview talking points

**Status**: Complete and demo-ready

## Documentation Quality Checklist

- [x] Professional formatting
- [x] Clear visual diagrams
- [x] Concrete examples
- [x] Technical depth without jargon
- [x] Readable by non-experts
- [x] Includes performance data
- [x] Shows design thinking
- [x] Interview-ready

---

## Files Created/Updated (Day 7)

1. `README.md` - Updated with evaluation results
2. `docs/architecture.md` - Complete system architecture
3. `docs/SYSTEM_DESIGN.md` - **NEW** - Demo-scale design document
4. `docs/DAY7_CHECKLIST.md` - **NEW** - This file

---

## What You Can Now Do

✅ **Show interviewers**:
- Open `README.md` → 2-command quick start
- Open `docs/architecture.md` → Full system diagram
- Open `docs/SYSTEM_DESIGN.md` → Simplified pipeline explanation

✅ **Explain in interviews**:
- "I documented the complete architecture with component diagrams"
- "The README shows how to run the system in 2 commands"
- "I included design rationale for each technology choice"

✅ **Demonstrate systems thinking**:
- Compared demo scale vs production scale
- Documented when to upgrade each component
- Included performance metrics and success criteria

---

## Day 7 Status: ✅ COMPLETE

**Time spent**: ~20 minutes
**Interview value**: HIGH (shows communication skills + systems thinking)
**Maintenance**: Minimal (update only when adding major components)
