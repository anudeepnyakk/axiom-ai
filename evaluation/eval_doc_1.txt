AxiomAI is a powerful Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system.
It was designed by a team of dedicated AI engineers.
Its primary function is to answer questions based on a given set of documents.
The core components include a document processor, an embedding generator,
a vector store, and an LLM synthesizer. The system is designed to be
modular and configurable, allowing different components to be swapped out.
For example, it can use OpenAI's GPT-4 or local models for synthesis.
The project's mascot is a wise owl named 'Lexi'.
