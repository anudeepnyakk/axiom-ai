### **High-signal questions for “Designing Data-Intensive Applications”**

Use a mix of these; they probe different parts of the book and show off retrieval + reasoning:

- **Foundations**
  - **“What does Kleppmann mean by a *data-intensive* application?”**  
  - **“Explain the differences between availability, reliability, and fault tolerance in this book’s terms.”**

- **Data Models & Storage**
  - **“How does Kleppmann compare relational, document, and graph data models?”**  
  - **“What are the trade-offs between normalized schemas and denormalized documents?”**

- **Distributed Systems**
  - **“According to the book, what are the main causes of *replication lag* and why do they matter?”**  
  - **“How does leader-based replication differ from multi-leader and leaderless replication?”**  
  - **“What problems does network partitioning cause, and how does the book frame the CAP theorem?”**

- **Batch vs Stream**
  - **“What is the difference between batch processing and stream processing, and when would you choose each?”**  
  - **“How does the book define *event sourcing* and how is it related to log-based systems?”**

- **Consistency & Transactions**
  - **“What are the limitations of ACID transactions in distributed systems, according to Kleppmann?”**  
  - **“Explain the difference between linearizability and serializability as described in the book.”**

- **Practical Architecture**
  - **“What design principles does Kleppmann recommend for building evolvable data systems?”**  
  - **“How does the book suggest handling schema evolution without breaking existing clients?”**

Ask these exactly as written during the demo; they should all have rich, well-cited answers in that PDF.
