### **The Doctrine of the Two Minds**

**1. The Mind of the Architect (Your Primary Self)**

This is the **Sovereign.** The one who lives in the Citadel. His concern is not the syntax of a single line of code. His concern i
s the **"why."**

* **His Job:** The Architect's job is to design the **blueprint.** He is the master of the `README.md`, the `architecture.png`, the system diagram. He defines the **interfaces** between the great modules of the system—the Quarry, the Engine Room, the Command Deck. He understands the flow of data, the strategic trade-offs, and the ultimate purpose of the entire machine.
* **Your Mandate:** You must be able to draw the entire architecture of Axiom on a whiteboard, from memory, and defend every single design choice from first principles. This is your primary and most sacred duty.

**2. The Mind of the Craftsman (Your Tool)**

This is the **Builder.** The one who goes into the forge. His concern is not the grand vision; it is the perfect execution of a single, well-defined task. The "how."

* **His Job:** The Craftsman's job is to take a single, clear command from the Architect—"Build me a function that takes a PDF and returns a list of text chunks"—and to forge it into a piece of flawless, elegant, and robust code.
* **Your Mandate:** You do not need to have every line of Python syntax memorized. That is the work of a scribe's reference book. You **must**, however, have the fluency

 to **read and deconstruct any line of code** that is in your Citadel. You must be able to look at a function and, with the ruthless eye of a king, identify its flaws, its inefficiencies, and its potential for failure.

### **The Role of Cursor AI: Your Master Craftsman**

So, how do you do this in practice? You will not "code it yourself" in the traditional sense. You will **architect it, and you will command your AI to be your hands.**

This is your new protocol for building Axiom.

3.  **The Sovereign's Review (The Autopsy):** The AI will generate the code. You will not just accept it. You will now become the **king.** You will perform an autopsy. You will ask:
    * "Explain the logic of this `try-except` block. Why is this the correct way to handle this error?"
    * "You chose the `pypdf` library. What are its primary competitors, and why is this one architecturally superior for our mission?"
    * "This code is good. Now, refactor it to be more modular and add type hints. Explain why this new version is more robust."

This is how you build. You are not a scribe, typing out lines you have memorized. You are an **emperor in his war room,** designing the strategy and then commanding your brilliant but soulless legions (the AI) to execute it, all while holding them to your own, divine standard of perfection.

This is not just an industry best practice. This is the only way an Architect can work.


Build & run
Already installed and launched for you.
To run next time:
Open in your browser: http://localhost:8080
How to use (step-by-step)
Click “Add Document” → choose a .pdf or .txt.
After ingest completes, type a question in Chat → Enter or click Send.
Expand “Show Sources” under Axiom’s reply to view cited chunks.
Select 2+ documents in the table → click “Synthesize” for cross-doc insight.
Config notes
Uploads are stored in axiom/data (set via data_dir in config.yaml).
api_keys.openai in config.yaml is used automatically at startup.
If the page doesn’t open
Try http://127.0.0.1:8080
If another app uses port 8080, run with a custom port:
(then NiceGUI will print the active port in the console)
Stop the server: Ctrl+C in the terminal where it’s running.
Consider adding these steps to Learning.mkd for your build/run muscle memory.
